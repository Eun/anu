# Anu

> Anu means [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom) in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) ⚛️

## Motivation

I work at [ThemeSelection](https://themeselection.com) and for couple of times I had to build small Vue projects that required UI flexibility. I couldn't use Bootstrap because customization is not straight forward compared to frameworks like UnoCSS, WindiCSS & TailwindCSS.

Then there's a guy named [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu) who is great inspiration to me. He built great tools for vue ecosystem and I was using them in my every vue projects. Now the problem was repating the configuration & components in every project and there wasn't any component lib based on frameworks like UnoCSS to provide components for building UI quickly and provide enough flexibility.

Hence, I created this UI lib which provides ready to use beautiful components with utilities to build UI quickly.

### Why not TailwindCSS

You probably didn't read the UnoCSS [README](https://github.com/unocss/unocss#readme).

### Why dependencies

Anu is based on [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss), [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) & [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/). Anu have this dependencies because there's a saying "_Don't reinvent the wheel_".

UnoCSS will provide CSS utilities and more. Moreover, compared to TailwindCSS creating custom utilities is much easier than TailwindCSS.
